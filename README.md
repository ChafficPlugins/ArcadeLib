# ArcadeLib

**The most advanced non-bungeecord library for Minecraft minigames**

ArcadeLib is currently under development and there is no working release available yet. We are working on providing an
alpha version for testing as soon as possible.

## Contributing

ArcadeLib is designed to be extended and/or co-developed by other developers. We appreciate any support, whether it is
the development of a minigame (ArcadeLib Extension) or the improvement of the library.    
ArcadeLib is well documented, so
getting started with the code should be as easy as possible. The javadocs can be viewed here and small application
examples will be provided with the release of the first alpha.

- Consistent management of minigames
- Automatic arcade mode and single game mode
- Accessory and in game kit stores
- easy to use party system
- leaderboard
- guilds
- Karma system
- Minigame extension system
- Easy to use minigame creation
